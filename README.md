# CompassBrush
Software Prototyping final project. A drawing application for Android and researching on the existing drawing software and related materials. The main idea of the project was to build a drawing app without the traditional buttons, where the interaction is happening through the sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, light sensor, etc.). In addition, the existing drawing software and different ways of interaction were researched and analysed to make the gestures for controlling the app more natural though unique.

Developed with Processing for Android. 
In order to install, need to install Processing first, connect an Android device and run the code.
